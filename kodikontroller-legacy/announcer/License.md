LICENSE - Currently investigating

This code was pulled together from a number of free or GPLv3 examples,
most notably http://papermashup.com/php-gd-generate-an-image-with-text-and-font-embedding/
by Ashley Ford, although he appeared not to apply a license explicitly.

As far as i can tell no license was applied to this code otherwise listed as a "Free Resource"
I am attempting to rectify this and apply appropriate license & copyright statements.

Feel free to contact me should you wish to discuss any of the above.
