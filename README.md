### Current Status: It Lives, but needs love.

#### To do:
Kontroller:

	Variables to config.js
	CRON / Server
	Screen Online Status (Online / Timeout / Offline)
	Refactor into Object Oriented & PHP Slim
	Now Playing via JSON Call (JSONRPC.Ping)
	Time-Picker for Auto-On & Off - shows config.js selection and allows update / overide

Announcer:

	May be scrapped if we can move the code-base into service.LowerThird to allow real-time creation of announcements
	or woven into KK to allow previewing and "design" of longer-term announcements?
	Would apprecited some steer on this... it feels redundant if we can make LowerThird awesome
	
Slack2Kodi:

	Add trigger words for departmental regular announcements
	eg. Facilities - Fire, Coffee, Maintenance Issues
	    Digital - Web Builds
	    TechSo / Infra - Outages
	    
Kodi Work:

	LowerThird Addon - ability to draw text onnto .jpg and display in one JSON call
	"Awaiting Data" on Kodi boot - DONE - autoexec.py
	
Long-Term Work:

	New Kodi Skin (Display):
		Minimal Home Screen
		Quick Access to BBC News
	Standardised LibreElec build or Backup / Restore Option
	Chrominium Support - Project looks dead, ~20 versions behind production
