### Current Status: Started over December 2022.

	Refactor into Object Oriented & PHP Slim
	Now Playing via JSON Call (JSONRPC.Ping)
	Time-Picker for Auto-On & Off - shows config.js selection and allows update / overide

Announcer:

	May be scrapped if we can move the code-base into service.LowerThird to allow real-time creation of announcements
	or woven into KK to allow previewing and "design" of longer-term announcements?
	Would apprecited some steer on this... it feels redundant if we can make LowerThird awesome

		Minimal Home Screen
		Quick Access to BBC News
	Standardised LibreElec build or Backup / Restore Option
	Chrominium Support - Project looks dead, ~20 versions behind production
